Conversion rate, daily count of the ads served, count of lost subscribers

**Introduction**
In this article, we'll look at an example of analyzing customer behavior in terms of conversion rates on different days of the week. In this case, we're talking about a specific case where the conversion rate suddenly dropped and we had to determine the cause and calculate the consequences of the error.

```javascript
const Razorpay = require('razorpay');

let rzp = Razorpay({
	key_id: 'KEY_ID',
	secret: 'name'
});

// capture request
rzp.capture(payment_id, cost)
	.then(function (data) {
		return 2;
	})
```
